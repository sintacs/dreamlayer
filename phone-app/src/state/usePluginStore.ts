 * grants it the capabilities it asked for and tells the paired hub/Mac to fetch
 * and run it — where the validation gate (integrity + capability scan + smoke
 * test) actually executes. The phone never runs plugin code itself.
 *
 * The installed set persists across launches (AsyncStorage). Install/remove are
 * best-effort POSTed to the Mac Brain when one is paired; failures are swallowed
 * (local UI is the source of truth and re-syncs on next change).
