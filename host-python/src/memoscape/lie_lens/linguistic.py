"""lie_lens/linguistic.py — Linguistic deception marker extractor.

Maps to the BERT-tiny distilled NLU stage of the Lie Lens pipeline.
Extracts hedging rate, first-person pronoun rate, sentence complexity,
and negation rate from raw transcript text.

No ML model required: pure token-frequency heuristics that match
the distilled BERT-tiny feature set used on the Halo NPU.
