"""plugins/validate.py — the gate: does this plugin run cleanly, and is it safe?

Every plugin passes through here before it is ever installed or loaded. Five
lines of defence, cheapest first:

  1. **Manifest** — well-formed name/version/entry/capabilities/api.
  2. **Integrity** — the code's sha256 matches the manifest checksum, so what
     you validated is what you run (tampering is caught).
  2b. **Authenticity** — when the manifest carries an Ed25519 signature it
     must verify against the code payload with the manifest's public key
     (a bad signature is a hard error); when a trusted-keys registry is
     supplied, the key must be in it. Unsigned packages stay installable
     under the curated-registry model, labeled with a warning.
  3. **Static scan** — the source is parsed to an AST and screened for
     dangerous operations (subprocess, eval/exec, raw sockets, file writes,
     ctypes, dynamic import…). Each is allowed *only* if the manifest declared
     the matching capability — no undeclared reach. Nothing is executed.
  4. **Smoke load** — the module is imported in a fresh namespace and its
     factory is registered against a *mock* context. If it throws, or touches
     an extension point it didn't ask for, it fails here — not on your glasses.

Honest limit: in-process Python cannot be *fully* sandboxed — a determined
author can hide intent from a static scan. This gate is defence-in-depth
(integrity + declared capabilities + screen + smoke test) for a **curated,
reviewed** registry, not a jail for hostile code. True isolation (subprocess /
wasm / RestrictedPython) is the next hardening; see docs/MARKETPLACE.md.
