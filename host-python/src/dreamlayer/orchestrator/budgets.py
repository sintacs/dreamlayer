"""orchestrator/budgets.py — the latency contract, per surface.

A wearable answer is only an answer if it lands inside a perceptual
budget; after that it's an interruption. These constants are the contract
(one place, named), and run_with_deadline() is the enforcement — the same
worker+deadline shape WorldChecker already proved on the caption path.

| surface                    | budget    |
|----------------------------|-----------|
| glance name (tier 0)       | 350 ms    |
| glance panel ("what is it")| 1.5 s     |
| oracle ask                 | 2.5 s     |
| veritas world-check        | 2.5 s (world_check.py, unchanged) |
| answer-ahead               | 2.0 s or drop silently            |
| morning brief / REM        | unbounded, scheduled              |

A budget miss is not an error the wearer sees — it's a tier skipped (the
router moves on) and a failure recorded in the health ledger so the
builder sees the pattern.
