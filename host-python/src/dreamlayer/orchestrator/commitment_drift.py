"""commitment_drift.py — commitments as physics objects that bloom, crack,
and shatter based on *behavior and time*.

A commitment is a little object under two forces:

  time pressure   the clock pushes decay up toward the due date
  behavior        what you actually do pushes it back down — mentioning
                  it, working near it, or keeping it *heals* the object
                  toward bloom; abandoning it shatters it outright

Decay is a 0-1 float after both forces resolve:
  0.0 = brand new / plenty of time / freshly tended
  1.0 = past due with nothing done / shattered

State ladder (thresholds configurable via CommitmentDriftEngine constructor):
  blooming   decay < 0.20
  healthy    0.20 <= decay < 0.50
  drifting   0.50 <= decay < 0.75
  cracking   0.75 <= decay < 1.00
  shattered  decay >= 1.00

Behavior model
--------------
Every impulse of progress adds *heal credit* that subtracts from the time
decay, so a tended commitment blooms back down the ladder. Heal credit is
not permanent: it relaxes on a half-life (PROGRESS_HALFLIFE_S), so a
commitment you stop tending slides back under time pressure — momentum
bleeds, like a real physics object. Two terminal verbs override the
forces entirely: keep() blooms and pins it, break() shatters it.

Progress arrives two ways: explicitly (nudge/keep/break, e.g. from a phone
tap or a resolved rehearsal) and ambiently — tick() scans the memory
stream and any event that plainly refers to a commitment nudges it, so
simply living near the promise keeps it alive. Private events
(meta.private) are never observed.
