"""capabilities.py — read-only introspection over the optional-dependency seams.

DreamLayer ships 58 integrations as lazy adapters: each one `try/except`-imports
its library and falls back gracefully, so the core runs with nothing installed
(see docs/INTEGRATIONS.md). This module answers the operational question that
design creates: **on this machine, right now, what is actually switched on?**

Three layers, one file:

  installed   is the library importable?      (probed with find_spec — the
                                               module is never executed, so a
                                               broken native install can't
                                               crash the report)
  enabled     is it allowed?                   (env override: DL_DISABLE_<KEY>=1
                                               turns an installed capability off
                                               without uninstalling it)
  state       active / off / missing /         (what a builder or the panel
              unsupported / external            actually wants to know)

Deployment profiles (pyproject `profile-halo|phone|mac|cloud`) are composed
from the same extras groups the adapters document, so "switching on" a tier is
one command:  pip install -e ".[profile-mac]"  →  python -m dreamlayer.capabilities

Deliberately NOT here: no eager imports, no global registry that call sites
must consult, no second gating mechanism. The adapters keep their own lazy
`_HAS_X` guards as the runtime truth; this is the observability surface over
them. tests/test_capabilities.py asserts this file, the adapters' extras, and
pyproject's profile groups never drift apart.
