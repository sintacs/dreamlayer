"""confluence/beacon.py — The Beacon: find your people through a crowd.

Ride the GhostMode mesh with one job: point you at your group. Each member
emits a coarse **bearing + distance band relative to themselves** (never an
absolute location); on your rim it renders as a pulse train at that bearing —
nearer people pulse faster and brighter. No map, no "where are you" text.

Privacy: only bearing/presence crosses (it rides `MeshManager.emit`, so the
Veil silences it and forged/stranger traffic drops). Names never cross — the
card shows a member by the local alias you set, or a neutral tag.

Distance is a band, not a number: "close" / "near" / "far". That's all a
crowd-finder needs, and it's all we're willing to send.
