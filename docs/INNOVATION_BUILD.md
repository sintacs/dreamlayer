# Innovation Build — the working ledger

This is the execution ledger for turning [`INNOVATION_SESSION.md`](INNOVATION_SESSION.md)
into shipped code. Every idea is triaged into one lane and given a **home** (the
module/dir where it belongs) so nothing lands in the wrong place.

**Lanes**
- **BUILD** — code-reachable now (the seam exists unwired, or it's a pure fix). We implement it, tested, in its home.
- **OWNER** — needs hardware, silicon, an account, or a human decision the code can't make. Registered in [`AUDIT_ACTIONS.md`](AUDIT_ACTIONS.md); *not* faked here.
- **DONE** — already shipped (often this session). Verify + reference; no new work.
- **DECIDE** — a real fork the owner should call before we touch it (destructive delete, on-glass boot change, etc.).

Rule we learned on contact: **verify each idea against the current tree before acting** — several of the doc's critiques are already stale (e.g. `os_sandbox` is wired; the "LLM parser" is an honest optional seam, not "regex in a trenchcoat"; `datasette_app.py` already exists). Verify, then build.

## Log

- *(this file created)* — triaged the doc; started **B1 Memory Grep**.
- **B5 + B6 shipped** — Glass Desk devkit (`python -m dreamlayer.simulator --watch <plugin>` live-renders the card through the real device renderer with the safe-radius overlay) and Figment Golf (`dreamlayer golf verify` — budgets referee eligibility, score = expressiveness per byte).
- **D1 + D2 shipped** — LLM parser kept as a documented suggestion-layer; Nod to Remember wired host+grammar+boot-flag (default OFF) with a lupa nod-injection test.
- **B1 shipped** — `dreamlayer memories path` (where your data lives) and `dreamlayer memories browse` (Datasette over the SQLite memory file: immutable/`-i`, bound to 127.0.0.1, veil-gated via `$DREAMLAYER_VEIL`/`veil.lock`, four canned queries shipped in the metadata). Exposed the pre-existing-but-unwired `memory/datasette_app.py`. Next: **B4** (verify `os_sandbox`) and the **D1 (LLM parser)** decision.
